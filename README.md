<p>
  Doracle is a patient management system useful for hospitals as well as patients. We intend to develop a secure, scalable application that adopts a set of revolutionizing steps that will pave the way to a better-managed hospital that will be able to provide superior healthcare advantages to its patients. Families no longer have to wait in long queues in dire situations waiting to know how their patient is. They will be provided a unique login credential for their patient with which, they will be able to login into the application and access real-time updates on the treatment status of their patients.
</p>

<strong>Doracle is made with Expo, a React-Native framework.</strong>
React Native brings [**React**'s][r] declarative UI framework to iOS and Android. With React Native, you use native UI controls and have full access to the native platform.

- **Declarative.** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
- **Component-Based.** Build encapsulated components that manage their state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- **Developer Velocity.** See local changes in seconds. Changes to JavaScript code can be live reloaded without rebuilding the native app.
- **Portability.** Reuse code across iOS, Android, and [other platforms][p].

React Native is developed and supported by many companies and individual core contributors.

## 📋 Requirements

React Native apps may target iOS 11.0 and Android 5.0 (API 21) or newer. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS. Tools like [Expo](https://expo.io) can be used to work around this.

## 🎉 Run project in development

- Setting up the development environment: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup.

- Install dependencies: `yarn install` (or `npm install`).

- Run the app: `expo start` (or `npm start`).

- Get QR code from localhost and scan it from Expo Go app in your phone.

## 📖 Documentation

The full documentation for React Native can be found on our [here][docs] and for Expo [here][docs1].

The React Native documentation discusses components, APIs, and topics that are specific to React Native. For further documentation on the React API that is shared between React Native and React DOM, refer to the [React documentation][r-docs].

## 🚀 Upgrading

Upgrading to new versions of React Native may give you access to more APIs, views, developer tools, and other goodies. See the [Upgrading Guide][u] for instructions.

React Native releases are discussed in the React Native Community, [**@react-native-community/react-native-releases**][repo-releases].
